            <h4>Doing today</h4>
            <p>
              “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning
              and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I
              want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer
              has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change
              something.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Crazy Enough</h4>

            <p>
              “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the
              world are the ones who do.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Quality</h4>

            <p>
              “Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much
              better than two doubles.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Courage</h4>
            <p>
              “Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow
              know what you truly want to become.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Heart</h4>
            <p>
              “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to
              avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are
              already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Apple</h4>
            <p>
              “Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever
              happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by
              the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one
              of the most creative periods of my life.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>No Cost</h4>
            <p>
              “My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really
              clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h4>Dogma</h4>
            <p>
              “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s
              life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results
              of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’
              opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have
              the courage to follow your heart and intuition.”
